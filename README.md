This is my university final year project with the title - AI-Based PV Module Extraction And Hotspot Fault Detection Using Image Processing Technique.

There are a few objectives to be clarified:
• To create a customized PV module extraction model based on YOLOv5 algorithm to identify and extract PV modules from the images.
• To capture and identify hotspot faults within silicon PV modules using thermal imaging technology.
• To create a Python-based graphical user interface to visualize the PV module extraction results and hotspot faults results.

Python is used for scripting, writing and implementing the algorithm for data analysis.
The object detection model is trained based on Yolov5 algorithm. 
Image processing library, OpenCV is implemented to extraction the PV panel from the images for analysis.
A graphical user interface is created based on Tkinter module for certain operations and data visualization.
